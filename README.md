## But why?

Actually, a lot of developers in Russia do not know about these projects and the fact that their authors are also Russian or post USSR programmers.

It warms your heart when you understand that a lot of highly popular and useful projects are made by “cold and gloomy” Russians.

The trigger is [this tweet](https://twitter.com/fobbyal/status/1290311704803340288) by [@fobbyal](https://github.com/fobbyal):

> Is there a cool open source project mainly contributed by Russian developers?

The goal of the project is to highlight how modern software is a product of global culture. There are many different nations in your `package-lock.json`, or `Gemfile.lock`, or elsewhere. And we are highlighting the Russian part just because we know it better. ([#2](https://github.com/igoradamenko/awesome-made-in-russia/issues/2))

## Contributing 

It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars as a measurement. It's not quite fair, but it is what we have here on Github.

If you want to add project to this list, please, make sure that:

1. The project was created by the developer born in Russia or self-indicate themself as a part of Russian ethnicity.
2. The project has more that 1000 stars on Github.

If they do, feel free to make a PR!

(Please, check twice that you have picked the correct category and added the project according to alphabetical order.)
